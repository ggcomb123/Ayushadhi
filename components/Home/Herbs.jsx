It is the most versatile, diverse (different varieties of species) tree in the tropical region (hot regions), that might have medicinal potential. Neem has a lot of beneficial non-wood products like flowers, leaves, fruits, bark, gum, oil, seeds, and neem cake (residue left over after oil is pressed from neem seeds).Leaf meals from some tropical legumes have been explored due to the need to look for alternative sources of food for humans and feed for livestock. Neem leaf meal was analysed in a study that found that it has 18.10% crude protein and relatively high crude fibre of about 15-56%. Though the  gross energy content was high at 4.16 kcal/g, the metabolizable energy is low.",

Neem leaf has traditionally been used for viral diseases such as chickenpox and smallpox as well.However, more studies are required to prove such claims.Bacterial infections and Skin infections: Recent studies have focused on antibacterial activities of neem in the mouth, specifically in gum disease and tooth cavities.Neem is also thought to be very effective in managing scabies, but sufficient scientific data does not exist for human studies.Since neem might have potential antimicrobial properties, it may be helpful for various skin problems and diseases such as acne, eczema, and other skin conditions. Neem oil might also help with psoriasis symptoms.Fungal infections: Studies have shown that neem might have antifungal characteristics, which might help with fungal infections like athlete’s foot, ringworm and candida, commonly called as a yeast infection or thrush-causing organism. Thrush is a fungal infection that can occur in the mouth, throat or other parts of the body.3 However, more research is required.",

These antioxidants might help to neutralize free radicals and may inhibit damage.",
